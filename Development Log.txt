************************

current commit:

created createGuardAlgoWindow() method in MainGUIClass
implementing ControllerGuardAlgoPane1
buttons to choose MikePosOrders inside GuardAlgoPane1 now working
checkbox in GuardAlgoPane1 working

consider erasing abstract class mikealgos.BaseAlgo since it is not being used by anything even though algos extend from it
for now, I moved public enum status from BaseAlgo to interface MikeAlgo
