Currently working on ChooserPosOrdersController

In PositionsWindow:
    create simple order entry pane in PositionsWindow: DONE
    buttons: buylmt, selllmt, buy stop, sell stop
    textareas: order size, order price

    another pane: buttons: Cancel all orders, Clear all positions, Print all orders, Print all positions DONE

In MikePosOrders:
    think through order placement and checking fills
//In mikePosOrders:
//set of activeOrders
//set of ordersToProcess
//set of processedOrders

//In orderServer:
//map of (orderID, activeOrders)
//map of (orderID, filledOrders)
//set of cancelledOrders

ORDER PROCESS:
1. call newOrder() in MikePosOrders
2. neworder() calls addOrder() in orderServer
3. orderServer creates new order and adds it to its activeOrders set
4. orderServer assigns unique orderID to the order and returns the orderID to mikePosOrders
5. mikePosOrders adds the order to its activeOrders set

CHECKING FOR FILLS:
1. checkfills called in orderServer


PRICESERVER:
1. Create PriceServerManager in mainModelThread
2. Add first default priceServer to PriceServerManager from mainModelThread
