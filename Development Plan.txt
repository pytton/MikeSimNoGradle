In MikePosOrders:
    think through order placement and checking fills
//In mikePosOrders:
//set of activeOrders
//set of ordersToProcess
//set of processedOrders

//In orderServer:
//map of (orderID, activeOrders)
//map of (orderID, filledOrders)
//set of cancelledOrders

ORDER PROCESS:
1. call newOrder() in MikePosOrders
2. neworder() calls addOrder() in orderServer
3. orderServer creates new order and adds it to its activeOrders set
4. orderServer assigns unique orderID to the order and returns the orderID to mikePosOrders
5. mikePosOrders adds the order to its activeOrders set

CHECKING FOR FILLS:
1. checkfills called in orderServer
